            <p>A "Single Page Application" refers to a system design concept that helps to improve the experience of the end user-- this is done by reducing the number of full-page reloads experienced when interacting with the website, which directly translates to a reduction in the amount of time a user spends waiting for the site to load. This results in seemingly instantaneous responses for the end user.</p>
